# Grutoring-Calender
Grutoring Calender seeks to consolidate the information of grutoring/Office Hours for various classes at Harvey Mudd College into a single, easy-to-read web platform. This will allow students to check the hours and locations for these resources in one location, instead of having to sift through syllabuses or Piazza pages to find this information. This platform will also seek to empower grutors and Professors to indicate their availability and changes to their schedules more dynamically, presenting all the information in a visually intuitive manner.
